# will not works because of we haven't install phpunit globally
How we can run phpunit form here
: vendor/bin/phpunit
Above command will ensure that phpunit is exist
<phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
    colors="true"
    verbose="true">
colors : Return output will return with color
verbose : Verbose will return some information like running time
stopOnFailure: Whenever some test failed it will stops other test

The word test is must important to the starting of method name

public function test_multiplication_of_two_number() {
    $a = 5;
    $b = 4;
    $c = $a * $b;

    $this->assertEquals($c, 20);
}

Or can be use /** @test */ before starting method, it is most clear and faster also

/** @test */
public function multiplication_of_two_number() {
    $a = 5;
    $b = 4;
    $c = $a * $b;

    $this->assertEquals($c, 20);
}

# Run command
